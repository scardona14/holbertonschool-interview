# UTF-8 Validation

This project focuses on implementing a UTF-8 validation algorithm to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Project Overview

### Description

In this project, you will write a function to validate UTF-8 data sequences. This function will help determine if a series of integers represents valid UTF-8 encoding, which is essential for handling data interchange in different languages and symbols.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand the structure and encoding process of UTF-8
- Learn the significance of Unicode in handling multilingual data
- Implement validation logic to identify valid UTF-8 sequences

## Requirements

### General
- **Editors Allowed**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS** using **Python 3.4.3**
- Each file must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- `README.md` at the root of the project directory is mandatory
- Code should adhere to **PEP 8** standards (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Testing and Review

Your progress will be updated as you work through the project. Be sure to test your code thoroughly for various UTF-8 data sequences before submitting.
