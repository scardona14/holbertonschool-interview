# Menger Sponge

## Description  
This project generates and displays a **2D Menger Sponge** fractal. A Menger Sponge is created by recursively subdividing squares and leaving the center part empty at each level. The level of the sponge determines how deeply the fractal is subdivided.

## Requirements  

### General  
- IDE: **Visual Studio**
- Language: C
- Libraries: **math library** (`-lm`)
- Code must be written using proper coding practices and follow the **Betty** coding style.
