# Lockboxes

## Project Overview

This project is about solving the "Lockboxes" problem. You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1`, and each box may contain keys to the other boxes. The goal is to write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.
