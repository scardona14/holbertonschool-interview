## Description

This project involves creating a function that generates Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. The function `pascal_triangle(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns a list of lists of integers representing the Pascalâ€™s triangle of size `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns an empty list.

## Requirements

### General Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on **Ubuntu 14.04 LTS**
- Compilation with **gcc 4.8.4** using the following flags: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic`
- All files must end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.
- Code must adhere to the **Betty style**. This will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- **No global or static variables** are allowed.
- **No more than 5 functions per file**.
- The standard library should **not** be used.
- The project includes examples with `main.py` files. These files are for testing purposes and are not required to be pushed. Your repository will be compiled using our own `main.py` files.
- All function prototypes must be declared in the `holberton.h` header file. Make sure to push your header file to the repository.

### Restrictions
- **No loops**
